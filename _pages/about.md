I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Université Paris Dauphine](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/).

My research lies at the intersection of behavioural economics and industrial organization, with applications to digital economics and food consumption.

I completed my PhD in Economics at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/about/) in September 2025. I have been Research Fellow at the [IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca](https://www.imtlucca.it/en/homepage) from May 2024 to October 2025.
