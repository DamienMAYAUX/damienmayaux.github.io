excerpt: 'Behavioral interventions, such as awareness campaigns or nudges, change the demand of few consumers but trigger a retail price reaction felt by all. In a theoretical model, I determine when and to what extent this price effect matters depending on market conditions. I also characterize which demand change among the few consumers is optimal to maximize the consumption of a given good by all. Making consumers more willing to pay may decrease consumption overall. Making them more sensitive to prices prevents opportunistic price reactions. I illustrate the empirical relevance of these findings with a structural model of a food industry calibrated on consumer panel data.'
